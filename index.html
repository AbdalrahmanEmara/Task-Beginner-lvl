            Awesome teaching support from 
            TAs who did the bootcamp 
            themselves. Getting guidance 
            from them and learning from 
            their experiences was easy.

            The staff seem genuinely concerned about my 
            progress which I find really refreshing. The 
            program gave me the confidence necessary to be 
            able to go out in the world and present myself as a 
            capable junior developer. The standard is above the 
            rest. You will get the personal attention you need 
            from an incredible community of smart and 
            amazing people.
